==== CloudSource ==== 
Cloudsource is a set of scripts developed by The New York Times and specifically by Cody Casterline. Cloudsource is used to deploy code found in SVN. It is a (heavily) modified version of Servermattic: http://code.trac.wordpress.org/browser/servermattic

Cloudsource consists of three shell scripts:

    * role.sh - The main driver script that performs deployment, rollback, and management of Cloudsource roles.
    * deploy.sh - Given that Cloudsource must be installed on the target, deployment server, deploy.sh performs the deployment of Cloudsource itself by running it on the target machine. You need to only run this script only once.
    * linkprop.sh - This script creates links on the installation filesystem that point to the regular files found in the Cloudsource roles. This script isn't normally run by the user.

==== Usage: role.sh ====

Description:
	role.sh is used to install ("apply") and manage "roles" that may apply to a system. 

Sample:
	./role.sh [--force] command [arg1] [arg2] [...]

Commands for ./role.sh:

	help
		Show this help"

	init
		Initialize the system. (You shouldn't have to run this.) 

	update-cs
		Update Cloudsource scripts from SVN.

	apply role1[,role2][...]

		Apply or re-apply a role by name. If you want to update the externals no matter 
		what the role revision, use the update command.

	apply role1 1234
		Applies version 1234 of role 'role1'.

	reapply-all
		Runs 'apply role' on all installed roles, updating them to the latest version.

	update role1[,role2][...]
		Update role along with externals without any limiting conditions.

	version
		Show the versions of installed roles. 

	list
		Show all roles defined in the SVN repository.

	status 
		Run 'svn status' on all roles to make sure no changes have 
		been made locally.

	log role
		Runs svn log on role 'role'.  

	revert role
		runs 'svn revert' on the role to undo local changes.  

	revert-all
		runs 'svn revert' on all roles to undo all local changes. 

	link role
		Link (or re-link) files from a role into their deploy location.

	unlink role
		Remove links for a role.

	externals [role]
		show all svn externals for 'role' (if defined) or all roles.

Options for ./role.sh:
	
	--force
		Ignore safety checks (up-to-date, no local modifications) and proceed
		anyway

==== Checking revision of the roles ====
[root@domU-12-31-39-02-64-11:~] ~/bin/role.sh versions
ROLE: base
        current version:   424
        latest version:    424

ROLE: dc-ec2
        current version:   424
        latest version:    424

ROLE: php-base
        current version:   424
        latest version:    424

ROLE: php-nyt
        current version:   424
        latest version:    424

==== Rollback ====

Since we're letting SVN handle versioning (instead of a mix of manual/automatic version numbers), it's trivial to roll back to a previous version of a role. 'apply' now takes an optional revision number argument.

# ./role.sh apply uc-be 424
